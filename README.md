# PetConnect

## Introduction

- PetConnect is a virtual pet management application designed to help users reduce their mobile phone usage time.

## Instructions for use

- The home page displays the home of your pet “Luna” and shows the amount of time the user has used the phone and the amount of virtual currency that day.
- At the bottom there are five navigation options: Home, Pocket, Goals, Shop and Profile.

## Contribution component

- I completed the design and development of the HomeScreen.
- I also completed the tab navigation part of the main page, and the drawer navigation part which needs further optimization.
